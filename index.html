<h3> Who am I? </h3>

<p id=intro > Hi Im Zereda and I have a passion for learning and self-development.
I was a medical student who stumbled on coding and never looked back since! </br>
It was abit daunting at first, however I enjoyed the learning process and progressed through programming quite rapidly in my spare time. Since then I have made a few mini online projects to practice the skills that I had learnt! </p>
