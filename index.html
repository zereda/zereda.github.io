			<h2 class="heading" >Hello My Name Is Zereda</h2> <hr/>
			<p>Hi I'm Zereda and I have a passion for continuous learning and self-development. I am a foundation year 2 doctor who found coding interesting and dived in whilst I was a medical student! It was a bit daunting at first, however I enjoyed the learning process and progressed through programming quite rapidly in my spare time (when I had spare time!). Since then I have made a few mini online projects (including this website) to practice the skills that I had learnt.</p>
			<p>I am also keen in radiology as a specialty and have decided that this blog shall be a personal website to record my learnings and personal experience from my radiology department. I would also include some articles or things that I found interesting relating to radiology and IT.</p>
			<p>This is my personal site. Views expressed here are mine alone and not those of my employer. All medical reflections or views on this site are purely my own thoughts and should not be considered as guideance or advice.</p>
